                <h2>
                    Early years
                </h2>
                <br>
                <p class="first-years">
                    Following the sucession from Ac Milan, the club was created in 1908. The dispute was over Ac Milan's
                    descision
                    to focus solely on italian players, and exclude non-italians. The new club was named Internazionale
                    in
                    honor of its founders, suggesting that it was open to players of all nationalities.
                 <br>
                    It didn’t take long for the club to begin its ascent to greatness,
                    as the first Scudetto was won only two years after its inception.
                    In 1938, they won their first Coppa Italia trophy, thanks to Giuseppe Meazza’s inspired performances. 
                    Meazza became Inter’s all-time leading goalscorer of all time with 288 goals,
                     and the club’s stadium was eventually named in his honour.
                </p>     
                     <br>
                     <p class="first-years">
                     But it wasn’t all a fairy tale. The Milan club had to conform to political orders once the National Fascist Party 
                     took power in 1922. These circumstances necessitated a merger with another club, 
                     Unione Sportiva Milanese, and the renaming of the club Società Sportiva Ambrosiana. 
                     When fascism in Italy came to an end in 1943, the club was able to revert to its previous name.

               <br>
                <h2> Grande Inter (1960-1967)</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="first-years">
                    In 1960, manager Helenio Herrera joined Inter from Barcelona, bringing with him his midfield general Luis Suárez, 
                    who won the European Footballer of the Year in the same year for his role in Barcelona's La Liga/Fairs Cup double.
                     He would transform Inter into one of the greatest teams in Europe. 
                     He modified a 5–3–2 tactic known as the "Verrou" ("door bolt") which created greater flexibility for counterattacks.
                     The catenaccio system was invented by an Austrian coach, Karl Rappan. Rappan's original system was implemented with four fixed defenders,
                      playing a strict man-to-man marking system, plus a playmaker in the middle of the field who plays the ball together with two midfield wings.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="first-years">
                      Herrera would modify it by adding a fifth defender, the sweeper or libero behind the two centre backs. 
                       The sweeper or libero who acted as the free man would deal with any attackers who went through the two centre backs. 
                       Inter finished third in the Serie A in his first season, second the next year and first in his third season.
                       Then followed a back-to-back European Cup victory in 1964 and 1965, earning him the title "il Mago" ("the Wizard").
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Mixed fortunes (1991-2004)</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="first-years">
                    The 1990s was a period of disappointment. While their great rivals Milan and Juventus were achieving 
                    success both domestically and in Europe, Inter were left behind, with repeated mediocre results in the domestic league standings, 
                    their worst coming in 1993–94 when they finished just one point out of the relegation zone. Nevertheless, 
                    they achieved some European success with three UEFA Cup victories in 1991, 1994 and 1998.
                    With Massimo Moratti's takeover from Ernesto Pellegrini in 1995, Inter twice broke the world record transfer fee in this period
                     (£19.5 million for Ronaldo from Barcelona in 1997 and £31 million for Christian Vieri from Lazio two years later). 
                     However, the 1990s remained the only decade in Inter's history in which they did not win a single Serie A championship. 
                     For Inter fans, it was difficult to find who in particular was to blame for the troubled times and this led to some icy 
                     relations between them and the chairman, the managers and even some individual players.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="first-years">
                    Moratti later became a target of the fans, especially when he sacked the much-loved coach Luigi Simoni 
                    after only a few games into the 1998–99 season, having just received the Italian manager of the year award 
                    for 1998 the day before being dismissed. That season, Inter failed to qualify for any European competition for 
                    the first time in almost ten years, finishing in eighth place.

                    Inter's misfortunes continued, losing the 2000 Supercoppa Italiana match against 
                    Lazio 4-3 after initially taking the lead through new signing Robbie Keane. 
                    They were also eliminated in the preliminary round of the Champions League by Swedish club Helsingborgs IF, 
                    with Álvaro Recoba missing a crucial late penalty. Lippi was sacked after only a single game of 
                    the new season following Inter's first ever Serie A defeat to Reggina.
                </p>

                <h2>Comeback and unprecedented treble (2004-2011)</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="first-years">
                    On 8 July 2004, Inter appointed former Lazio coach Roberto Mancini as its new head coach. 
                    In his first season, the team collected 72 points from 18 wins, 18 draws and only two losses, 
                    as well as winning the Coppa Italia and later the Supercoppa Italiana. On 11 May 2006, 
                    Inter retained their Coppa Italia title once again after defeating Roma with a 4-1 aggregate victory 
                    (a 1-1 scoreline in Rome and a 3-1 win at the San Siro).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="first-years">
                    Inter were awarded the 2005-06 Serie A championship retrospectively after title-winning Juventus was relegated and 
                    points were stripped from Milan due to the match fixing scandal that year. During the following season, 
                    Inter went on a record-breaking run of 17 consecutive victories in Serie A, 
                    starting on 25 September 2006 with a 4-1 home victory over Livorno, and ending on 28 February 2007, 
                    after a 1-1 draw at home to Udinese. On 22 April 2007, Inter won their second consecutive Scudetto—and first on 
                    the field since 1989—when they defeated Siena 2-1 at Stadio Artemio Franchi. Italian World Cup-winning defender Marco Materazzi scored both goals
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="first-years">
                    On 2 June 2008, Inter appointed former Porto and Chelsea boss José Mourinho as new head coach.
                     In his first season, the Nerazzurri won a Suppercoppa Italiana and a fourth consecutive title, 
                     though falling in the Champions League in the first knockout round for a third-straight year, 
                     losing to eventual finalist Manchester United. In winning the league title Inter became the first 
                     club in the last 60 years to win the title for the fourth consecutive time and joined Torino and
                      Juventus as the only clubs to accomplish this feat, as well as being the first club based outside Turin.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="first-years ey-heading">
                    Inter won the 2009-10 Champions League, defeating reigning champions Barcelona in the semi-final before beating 
                    Bayern Munich 2-0 in the final with two goals from Diego Milito.[28] Inter also won the 2009-10 Serie A title 
                    by two points over Roma, and the 2010 Coppa Italia by defeating the same side 1-0 in the final. 
                    This made Inter the first Italian team to win the treble.[30] At the end of the season, 
                    Mourinho left the club to manage Real Madrid, he was replaced by Rafael Benítez.

                <h3>Iconic players</h3>
                <br>
                <p class="first-years">
                    <strong> Giuzeppe Meazza-</strong>
                    When a team’s home stadium is named after one of their players, you know the player made a significant impact on the squad during his time there.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="first-years">
                    Meazza was scheduled to play for AC Milan but was turned down because he was underweight. 
                    That was perhaps one of AC Milan's most egregious errors in their history, and it will not be easily forgotten.
                    Meazza began his Inter career as a defender, but the coach swiftly pushed him to the front,
                    and Meazza quickly established himself as one of Italy's top strikers.
                    He scored 31 goals in his first season and 288 goals in his career, 
                    making him one of the most prolific scorers in the national team and Inter's history.
                </p>
                <br>
                
                <p class="first-years">
                    <strong> Javier Zanetti-</strong>
                    The ageless Zanetti is one of the finest players in world soccer history, always understated. 
                    Zanetti has 819 appearances for Inter in all competitions, making him the most capped player in club history.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="first-years">
                    Zanetti went 12 years without being sent off in a match. The first time he was sent off in his career was 
                    on 17 February 1999 in a Coppa Italia match against Parma, but he broke his streak when he was 
                    sent off in a Serie A match against Udinese on 3 December 2011. These were the only two times 
                    he was sent off during his entire career at Inter.
