# The legends of Italian football
My idea with this project was to create something based on my own interest, and among them you'll find sports. Inter has always been an exciting team for me to follow, and as a possible new supporter of the club, it can be interesting to have a short but at the same time informative website.

This website is for new, but also loyal supporters of the club, to be able to stay up to date on the current situation, explore the club's progress and history, and be able to enjoy fantastic pictures from Inter's time.
Inter is a team from the legendary history, and this website helps the interested souls to get to know them better in one place.
